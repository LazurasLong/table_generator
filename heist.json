      "magical; the target is in a pocket dimension, another plane, or in a dragon's dream",
      "religious; the target is in a church, cultist hangout, or some other location of religious significance",
      "inhospitable; the target is on a dangerous plane, in blizzard-wracked mountains, the underdark, or somewhere else where no one wants to go",
      "important; the target is in a government building, dragon's hoard, or somewhere else that is doubly protected because the location itself is important"
